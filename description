Description: This is a HOAS-based encoding of the pi-calculus (as originally
             conceived by Milner, Parrow and Walker in "A Calculus of Mobile
             Processes" Parts I-II, Information and Computation n. 100)
             together with the formal verification of a large part of the
             metatheory of Strong Late Bisimilarity.
