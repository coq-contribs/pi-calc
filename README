Pi-calculus in Coq

-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a HOAS-based encoding of the pi-calculus (as originally
conceived by Milner, Parrow and Walker in "A Calculus of Mobile
Processes" Parts I-II, Information and Computation n. 100) together
with the formal verification of a large part of the metatheory of
Strong Late Bisimilarity.

All the source files are part of "Pi-calculus in (Co)Inductive Type
Theory", a joint work with Furio Honsell and Marino Miculan (accepted
for publication on TCS).  If you are interested you can find more
information (and a gzipped PostScript version of the mentioned
article) at the following URL:

Coq Source Code:

In the file 'picalcth.v' there is the encoding of the syntax, labelled
transition system (LTS) and Strong Late Bisimilarity (as a GFP of a
suitable monotonic operator and as a coinductive predicate).

In 'xadequacy.v' there is the formal proof of the equivalence of the
two abovementioned encodings of Strong Late Bisimilarity.

Axioms and facts concerning syntactic contexts and variables can be
found in 'hoaspack.v'.

The basic properties of the LTS and Strong Late Bisimilarity are
proved in 'basiclemmata.v'.

In 'alglaws.v' there is the formal verification of a large part of the
metatheory of Strong Late Bisimilarity.

Finally in 'bangpack.v' there is the proof of the congruence of Strong
Late Bisimilarity w.r.t. the ! (bang) operator.
